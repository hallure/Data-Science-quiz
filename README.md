# 🐍 Beginner Python Projects

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly Python projects to demonstrate core programming concepts such as user input handling, conditionals, loops, and basic logic.

Each script was written as part of my early-stage data science and Python learning journey. All programs are interactive and run in a terminal or Jupyter/Colab environment.

## 📌 Project Descriptions

### 1. 🧠 Quiz Game
A 5-question interactive quiz that allows users to answer and receive their score at the end.

- Questions and answers are stored in a list of dictionaries.
- Input is case-insensitive.
- Correct answers increase the score; incorrect answers display the correct answer.
- Final score is shown after all 5 questions.

🔹 **Concepts Used**: Dictionaries, loops, input validation, conditional logic.

---

### 2. 🔁 Number Swapping
A simple script to swap two numbers entered by the user using Python’s tuple unpacking method.

- Handles invalid input gracefully.
- Displays numbers before and after swapping.
- No temporary variable used.

🔹 **Concepts Used**: Tuple unpacking, input validation, data types.

---

### 3. 🔍 Prime / Armstrong / Palindrome Checker
An interactive tool that checks if a number is:
- A **Prime number**
- An **Armstrong number**
- A **Palindrome**

The program handles:
- Invalid input
- Accurate detection of all three properties
- Displays results with appropriate messages

🔹 **Concepts Used**: Mathematical logic, string manipulation, control structures.

### 4. 📈 Fibonacci Sequence Generator
Generates the first `n` terms of the Fibonacci sequence based on user input.

- Validates input to ensure it's a positive integer
- Iteratively calculates the sequence
- Gracefully handles non-integer or invalid input

🔹 **Concepts Used**: Loops, input handling, sequence logic.
